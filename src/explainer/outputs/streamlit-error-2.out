The issue lies in this line of code:

```python
hist_values = np.histogram(data[DATE_COLUMN].dt, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]
```

The error, `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'DatetimeProperties' and 'int'`, indicates that there is a type mismatch in your code. Specifically, `data[DATE_COLUMN].dt` returns a `DatetimeProperties` object, but you are attempting to use it in `np.histogram` with an integer `range`.

The intention seems to be creating a histogram of the number of pickups by hour. However, the histogram data should be generated using the hour extracted from the datetime, not the entire datetime properties.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Extract the hour from the datetime column before computing the histogram.
2. Use the `.hour` accessor to get the hours from the datetime object.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the problematic line:

```python
hist_values = np.histogram(data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]
```

This code correctly extracts the hour part from each entry in the `date/time` column and calculates the histogram using these hour values. The rest of your code should work as expected after this fix.
